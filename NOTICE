Lingr

Copyright © 2026 Victor Baxan

Lingr is an independent project created and maintained by a single developer.

The source code is intentionally made available so others can explore the ideas,
learn from the implementation, and understand how the system works.

If you find this project useful, interesting, or inspiring — that means a lot.

If you are interested in commercial use, collaboration, or contributing in a
meaningful way, please reach out rather than quietly repackaging the work.

Thank you for respecting the effort behind this project.
